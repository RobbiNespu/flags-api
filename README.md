# Country Flags API
An easy to use service for country flag images written in PHP using Silex.  
[GO TO SITE](https://flags.swcdn.org/)

## Installing it yourself
I would be more than happy to let you use my installation of this project at https://flags.swcdn.org/.
However, if for some reason, you want to setup your own, just follow these instructions:

Install backend deps by running ```composer install```. Then install frontend deps by running ```npm install```.  
If you are having issues with the routing (e.g. 404 Not Found when trying to access flag image) try following [this guide](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/doc/master/web_servers.html) about webserver configuration.

## Image Credits
The flag images come from http://flagpedia.net/download. Their site is awesome!

## Disclaimer
I made this in the middle of the night at 3 AM because I needed some distraction from my main project.  
As you can imagine, at said time one might not be extremely focused. I apologize for any weird code mistakes. ;)
